# Bo.Util

Basic, underscore-like utilities. But smaller, and modern mobile only.
	
	_ =

## Util.each
functional, generic iterator

		each: (collection, fn) ->

			if izzy.array collection
				for value, key in collection
					fn value, key
			else if izzy.object collection
				for key, value of collection
					fn value, key

## Util.extend
augment an object with one or more other objects

		extend: (obj, others...) ->

			if obj and others
				for other in others
					for key of other
						obj[key] = other[key]

			obj

## Util.fluent
make any function return `this` for easy functional style chainability

		fluent: (fn) ->

			->
				fn.apply @, arguments
				@

## Util.one
return the first key in an object (order not guaranteed, as objects are automatically sorted by key in some browsers)

		one: (collection) ->

			return id for id of collection
